Okay, I got a blog set up with Github pages and Jekyll. Jekyll is pretty dope! I had never used it before this weekend, and the site came together really quickly. I'm still trying to figure out how to get this site to appear on `dsberger.com` instead of the github.io URL. Add that to the infinite to-do list.

Anyway, what's ol' Dan Berger been up to? Oh, you know, doing everything wrong. Not focusing on learning anything in particular, just dabbling in a bunch of things. Not building anything substantial, just playing with fun little code problems. Not meeting new people, just sending out too many resumes that get ignored. How am I going to fix these problems? Here are three strategies.

### Strategy #1: Go All In On Node

Node is one of the many things I have dabbled with in the past few months. It's a mindfuck compared to Rails but I think I'm getting the hang of it. Obviously it's a very popular framework and, while it's just one of many things on my list of things to learn, it needs to take priority. Not only will it make me more employable, I want to be able to say that I learned a whole framework using freely available resources. That's serious web dev cred right there.

### Strategy #2: Build A Real App With The Node

I've had this half-finished personal finance app in various Rails, Angular, and even baby Node formats. Gonna focus on this thing and actually deploy it so I have a site to talk about with people.

### Strategy #3: Meet Some People

I signed up for a [Node meetup](http://nodeschool.io/oakland/) and a [free Angular 2 seminar](http://go.rangle.io/angular-2-online-training) to at least get talking to technologists again. I'm also gonna try to go to a general JS meetup. I had such a bad experience with my local Ruby/Rails group that it soured me on meetups, but everything I hear is that my experience was pretty unusual. Also, once I get the personal finance site up I'm going to get more aggressive about networking on [AngelList](http://angel.co/jobs). I got some good leads from AngelList a few months back, although nothing panned out.

Watch this space for updates!
